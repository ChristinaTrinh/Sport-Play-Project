# Sport-Play-Project
This project demonstrates the "is-a" relationship.

## Directions/Prompt is as follow:
Write an inheritance hierarchy that stores data about sports players. Create a common superclass and/or interface to store information common to any player regardless of sport, such as name, number, and salary. Then create sub- classes for players of your favorite sports, such as basketball, soccer, or tennis. Place sport-specific information and behavior (such as kicking or vertical jump height) into subclasses whenever possible.
